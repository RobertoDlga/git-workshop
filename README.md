# Git Workshop: History

Now we have made a couple of commits, but now what?

1. Run `git log` in your terminal
  * This command will display the commits of your project sorted by date.

#### The Commit
Each commit is composed of 4 things

* An Unique ID
* An Author
* A Date
* A Message

#### Go to the next section: Remote Repositories

Change the branch to `remote-repositories`
